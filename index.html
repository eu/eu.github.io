		<img src="example.png" alt="Example-Profile" title="Example Profile" >
		<h1>Getting the badge</h1>
		<p>The "badge" is nothing more than a label that you're a part of the <code>eu</code> team. To join the team:</p>
		<ol>
		    <li><a href="https://github.com/eu/join/edit/master/list.txt">Fork <code>list.txt</code></a> and add your username to the bottom of this file.</li>
		    <li>Propose the file changes.</li>
		</ol>
		I'll merge it and add you as soon as possible.
		<h1>Enabling the badge</h1>
		<p>To enable the badge, do the following:</p>
		<ol>
		    <li>Click the link in the Email you'll receive from GitHub asking if you wanna join the organization.</li>
		    <li>Go to the <a href="https://github.com/eu/">eu organization</a>.</li>
		    <li>Click "People".</li>
		    <li>Search for your name in the list.</li>
		    <li>Click the "Private" lock next to your name.</li>
		    <li>Select "Public" from the dropdown.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>That's it! You'll now have the badge displayed on your GitHub Profile.</p>

		<blockquote>This organization has no relation with the European Union. This is just done by some guy who happens to have the username. (>_<)</blockquote>
